Bug List:

[1] Crashes on open with AMD GPUs
- Details:
This program does not like running OpenGL on AMD GPUs, and will crash on launch. Seems to be an OpenFrameworks problem.
- Fixes:
Use "glewExperimental= GL_TRUE;" in main.cpp
- Status:
Open

[2] Screen is gray when ofxTweakBar is not being interacted with
- Details:
When all GUI windows are minimized and none of the buttons are highlighted, the screen is flushed with gray. This does not happen on my personal laptop -- might be an issue with Nvidia GPUs.
- Fixes:
Don't minimize all windows
- Status:
Open

[3] OVR SDK crashes when quitting
- Details:
When destroying the ofxOculusRift instance, the program crashes.
- Fixes:
Disable the line of code that destroys the instance.
- Status:
Closed (watch for leaks)
