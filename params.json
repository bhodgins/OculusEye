{"name":"OculusEye","tagline":"Open source augmented reality for the Oculus Rift","body":"### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at https://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.\r\n\r\n#OculusEye\r\nOculusEye is an open-source wearable augmented reality platform with a focus on cost-effectiveness. The software portion of this project is based on OpenCV 3.0. The hardware is comprised of cheaply available parts: two Playstation 3 Eye cameras, and a [modular, 3d-printable mount](/etc/models).\r\n\r\n![Photo of prototype](http://i.imgur.com/MxHzK2b.jpg)\r\n[![OculusEye Prototype Footage](http://img.youtube.com/vi/RTLH47_6cyU/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTLH47_6cyU)\r\n\r\n#How to use OculusEye\r\nControls:\r\n\r\n| Key    |  Effect                                      |\r\n|:------ |:-------------------------------------------- |\r\n| C      |  Begin / end camera calibration              |\r\n| F      |  Toggle fullscreen                           |\r\n| + / -  |  Increase / decrease interpupillary distance |\r\n| ESC    |  Quit                                        |\r\n\r\nYou'll find toggles at the bottom-left to open windows that reveal various settings to play with.\r\n\r\n#Requirements\r\nFor reference, this program was developed on a mid-2012 MacBook Pro 13-inch with OSX 10.10 (Yosemite).\r\n\r\n\r\nThis program was built for Mavericks, but tested exclusively on Yosemite. Your mileage may vary greatly depending on your hardware. Bugs may present themselves on Macs with AMD GPUs. Intel GPUs work well (right?) and NVidia GPUs run with minor graphical errors.\r\n\r\n#Build Instructions\r\nYou will need to download the [OpenFrameworks 64-bit OSX branch](https://github.com/NickHardeman/openframeworks_osx_64). The project file goes in the same directory as any other OpenFrameworks project (openframeworks_osx_64/apps/myApps/). Open the XCode project and build the \"OculusEye Release\" scheme. The result will be placed in the /bin directory at the root folder of the project.\r\n\r\nEverything in the /data directory will be copied into /bin/data.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n#License\r\nThis program is licensed under the MIT License.
