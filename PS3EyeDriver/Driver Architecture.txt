This creates a .bundle that gives texture data from one or two Playstation Eye cameras.

For modularity purposes, this module will hold:
- (int, int) Camera Resolution
- (*uchar[]) RGB array for both cameras


As such, this module should be a black box to the rest of OculusEye, returning only camera data as RGB arrays.


This bundle should as a bonus be compatible with Unity3D.
